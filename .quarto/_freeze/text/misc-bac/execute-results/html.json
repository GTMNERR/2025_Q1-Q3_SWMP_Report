In 2019, collections for *Enterococcus* bacteria began and both are now collected at all four stations. Due to overnight shipping requirements, all bacteria samples are qualified by the DEP laboratory as out of hold times. For proper analyses, hold times for these samples are not to exceed 8 hours from collection. Therefore, the SWMP uses this data to show general patterns and trends only. \n\n<!-- ## Summary -->\n\n<!-- Elevated DOC levels were observed at all stations in 2024 (@fig-doc-boxplots), with low- level observations at Pine Island and Pellicer Creek in July. Pellicer Creek had the most median or lower quartile results (@fig-doc-boxplots). -->\n\n<!-- Bacteria is detected in water samples from Pellicer Creek more often and in higher quantities than the other three stations (@fig-bacteria-1; @fig-bacteria-2). Fecal coliforms are also often detected at San Sebastian (@fig-bacteria-2). So far this year, bacteria samples were elevated at all stations in 2024.  -->\n\n## Dissolved Organic Carbon\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-doc-boxplots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pine Island](misc-bac_files/figure-html/fig-doc-boxplots-1.png){#fig-doc-boxplots-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![San Sebastian](misc-bac_files/figure-html/fig-doc-boxplots-2.png){#fig-doc-boxplots-2 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fort Matanzas](misc-bac_files/figure-html/fig-doc-boxplots-3.png){#fig-doc-boxplots-3 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pellicer Creek](misc-bac_files/figure-html/fig-doc-boxplots-4.png){#fig-doc-boxplots-4 width=672}\n:::\n\nHistorical monthly dissolved organic carbon at each SWMP water quality station with current year monthly value overlaid in red.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Bacteria\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-bacteria .cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![*Enterococcus* detected in water samples showing only values over the minimum detection limit of 10 MPN/100mL.](misc-bac_files/figure-html/fig-bacteria-1.png){#fig-bacteria-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fecal coliforms detected in water samples showing only values over the minimum detection limit of 10 CFU/100mL.](misc-bac_files/figure-html/fig-bacteria-2.png){#fig-bacteria-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nBacteria detected in monthly water samples collected at the four long-term water quality stations in the GTMNERR.\n:::\n",
