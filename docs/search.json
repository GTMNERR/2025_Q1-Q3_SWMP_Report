    "text": "The System-Wide Monitoring Program\nUnderstanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

    "text": "1.1 Station Information\nThe continuous water quality component of the SWMP is comprised of four fixed monitoring stations, at which automated instruments (data sondes) are deployed to continuously collect information on a suite of water quality parameters. Discrete water samples are collected monthly for nutrients and other parameters at these same four stations, with an additional diel sampler deployed at one station. To complement the water quality data, the GTMNERR also operates and maintains one continuous meteorological station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll SWMP data are publicly available for download through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO).

    "text": "1.2 Locations\nThe climate of Northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and is characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States. The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve. The red line represents the boundary of the GTM Research Reserve and the sites are indicated with a blue pin. The sites are named based on the nomenclature of the NERRs SWMP.\n\n\n\nThe four SWMP water quality stations operated in the GTMNERR are Pine Island, San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek (Figure 1.2). The locations of these stations were selected to represent the influence of watersheds with varying degrees of urban development and reflect a diversity of physical processes (e.g., tidal exchange, freshwater input) and climatic conditions. The weather station is located near the mouth of Pellicer Creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: SWMP Water Quality Stations"

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at the CDMO.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

The precipitation sensor measured 15-min totals. Historically, a CR10x-2M logger was used to collect meteorological data. The CR10X-2M logger sampled all weather station sensors every 5 sec and calculated both hourly and daily averages for air temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Additionally, instantaneous samples of these parameters were recorded every 15 min. Precipitation data were summed and recorded as 15-minute, hourly, and daily totals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Weather Station at Pellicer Creek during a monthy data download and station cleaning and maintenance in September, 2020.\n\n\nA maximum four-week sampling interval (i.e., time between data downloads) was used to avoid losing data and to provide for regular inspection and maintenance of the station. At each visit to the station, sensor performance was checked by comparing weather station values to those of a handheld Kestrel 4000 wind/weather instrument. All sensors were inspected for damage or debris and repaired and cleaned accordingly after the download of data were downloaded to a Palm Pilot. Except for the rain gauge (which was calibrated in-house), all sensors were removed and sent to Campbell Scientific for re-calibration when appropriate. In addition to data obtained directly from the data logger, data were also transmitted via Campbell Scientific telemetry equipment to a NOAA GOES satellite hourly."

    "text": "2.2 Water quality – continuous\nThe continuous water quality stations were equipped with YSI 6-Series Multiparameter (2003-2015) and YSI EXO2 (2015-present) data sondes. The sondes were anchored within a 10-cm (inside diameter) PVC housing pipe mounted vertically onto a piling. Either a steel pin at the bottom of the pipe held the sonde at a position within 1 m from the bottom, or the sonde was suspended by a chain or rope such that the sensor portion of the sonde extended beyond the end of the PVC housing 1 m from the bottom. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2-cm holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe. Hole density was greatest near the base where the sonde sensors were located.\nData sonde exchanges at all stations were made at approximately two-week intervals and usually took less than five minutes. The inside of each deployment tube was scraped clean with a customized tool prior to the deployment of the newly calibrated sonde. All calibration, post-deployment readings, and reconditioning of the sondes and sensors were performed in accordance with the methods outlined in the standard operating procedures for the sonde model, in addition to procedures created by the NERRS CDMO (NERRS, 2013).\nData sondes collected temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth (water depth above instrument placement), and turbidity data at 30-min intervals, beginning at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring stations in December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek monitoring stations in February 2002. In January 2007, the NERRS changed from collecting continuous data at 30-min intervals to 15-min intervals. Data used in this report contain both sampling intervals."

Grab samples were collected from all stations in duplicate using a pole sampler and bucket. Diel samples were only collected at the Pellicer Creek station at 2.5-hour intervals for a 25-hour (lunar day) period using a Teledyne ISCO automatic sampler equipped with an internal ice bath to keep samples cold. Both grab and diel samples were collected from the approximate depth of the sonde sensors, 1 m above the bottom. Samples were filtered in the field whenever feasible; otherwise, they were placed on ice in the dark and filtered immediately upon returning to the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Grab sample collection using sampling pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Diel sampler deployed at Pellicer Creek station.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Collection methods for nutrient analyses\n\n\nWater samples collected between January 1, 2003 and June 30, 2010 were collected and analyzed by University of Florida’s (UF) Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

Samples collected on or after December 1, 2012 were collected by GTMNERR and analyzed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s (FDEP) Central Laboratory. Both laboratories were certified through the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program and used the American Public Health Association and Environmental Protection Agency methods for analyses.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Anomalous data were evaluated to determine whether values were:\n\noutside the expected range for the site, or\noutside the range of measurements established by YSI for the sensors.\n\nData were investigated for validity based on weather and field observations, quality control checks, graphs, and instrument diagnostics. Yearly data files were compiled, and data were deleted if anomalies were attributed to sensor malfunctions. Other anomalous data were marked as suspect in the accompanying yearly metadata document. Both the annual data file and metadata were submitted to the CDMO for archiving and review. The CDMO evaluated the reserve’s findings by performing a tertiary review process. The tertiary process included evaluating the files for completeness, ensuring that supporting documentation was submitted, and offering suggestions for improvements to the data.\nAll data files collected prior to 2007 are referred to as “historic” data files by the CDMO. Beginning in January 2007 and continuing to present, all SWMP data files undergo a three-step QA/QC protocol outlined in the CDMO’s Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2015). In addition to the secondary and tertiary processes listed above, data files undergo a primary QA/QC process, in which an automated QA/QC is performed by the CDMO upon the upload of the raw data file using the CDMO’s Data Upload Service.\nOnce tertiary review is completed for data files, they are referred to as “authenticated” data. All data files used in this report have been authenticated with the exception of nutrient data collected in 2015-2019 and 2022-present, which have not undergone tertiary review. Historic data files were edited to include the updated QA/QC protocols that were implemented by the CDMO in 2007. Standardized QA/QC flags and codes were applied to the historic data files using finalized metadata reports. These files were updated to include suspect data flags and codes to keep consistency among all data files. Rejected and suspect data were removed from the data files prior to analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll water quality and weather data used in this report are downloadable through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office using their data portals. However, much of the nutrient data presented in this report is not fully available through the CDMO.

September had the greatest monthly total rainfall for 2024 (Figure 4.1 (b)). September also had the greatest number of rain days exceeding 10 mm/day (Figure 4.1 (c)) and more storms producing heavy rainfall (Figure 4.1 (d)). \nSeptember 2004 had the second highest monthly rainfall total recorded at the Pellicer Creek weather station (Table 4.1) and had the greatest amount of rainfall when compared to annual September data (Figure 4.2; Figure 4.2 (a); Figure 4.2 (b)). Total rainfall so far in 2024 is 1090.9 mm (Figure 4.2 (c)).\nLight intensity remained high in July and August but decreased drastically in September (Figure 4.3).\nDaily average air temperatures were variable during the first part of the year but surprisingly fell within the historical range for the GTMNERR station through September (Figure 4.4). January and March experienced a few daily average air temperature extremes below and above the average range (Figure 4.4).\nWhile there were some low water temperatures in January, daily water temperature averages were generally higher than average throughout the spring and early summer (Figure 4.5). Water temperature decreased in August and September with the onset of the large rain events and as a result water temperatures were below the historic average daily range at all four stations (Figure 4.5 (b); Figure 4.5 (c)).\nRainfall in January brought salinity levels lower than their average daily ranges (Figure 4.6), particularly at the stations farthest from the inlets (Figure 4.6 (a); Figure 4.6 (d)). However, the drought conditions in spring made salinity levels rise. Salinity stayed above the average daily range at all stations through July but was most pronounced at Pine Island (Figure 4.6 (a)). Salinity levels decreased to below the historic average daily range at all four stations in late August through September (Figure 4.6 (a); Figure 4.6 (b); Figure 4.6 (c); Figure 4.6 (d))."

    "text": "6.1 Tropical Cyclones\nThere was one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Milton, that had direct impacts in the GTM estuary during the Q4 reporting period. This brings the yearly total to three tropical cyclones: Hurricane Debby, Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton.\nNortheast Florida felt the impacts of Hurricane Debby August 4-6, 2024, as Debby approached Steinhatchee, Florida as a Category 1 hurricane and moved across the state bringing heavy rain and strong winds. The area was impacted by another tropical cyclone, Hurricane Helene, in late September. Hurricane Helene made landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida as a Category 4 storm. Very strong winds and rain caused significant storm surges and flooding in Northeast Florida. The impacts of Hurricane Helene can be seen in our SWMP data from September 25–26, 2024; however, we did unfortunately experience intermittent battery and sensor malfunctions during the storm, leaving our data incomplete.\nThe third storm of the season, Hurricane Milton, impacted the area on October 9-10, 2024. The major hurricane made landfall near Siesta Key on Wednesday, October 9, 2024, as a Category 3 storm. St. Augustine and St. Johns County experienced strong winds, heavy rains, and flooding Wednesday evening into Thursday. The strongest winds recorded at the GTMNERR weather station in 2024 were during Hurricane Milton. The strong winds were predominately from the east and the maximum wind speed was 26.1 m/s (58.4 mph) (Figure 6.2). Strong winds initially raised salinity at all stations (Figure 4.6)at the onset of the storm, however; the rainfall during the storm drastically decreased salinity as it made its way to this estuary, which was especially pronounced at Pellicer Creek (Figure 4.6 (d)).",

At post-calibration it gave “internal battery voltage is below 0.9V per cell” error and after replacing with alternative batteries, passed post-calibration checks. Evaluation revealed no issue with with the sensors or sonde itself. YSI Service Technicians recommended redeploying the sonde in the lab for a couple of days and check the data for rapid battery drain as it could have been faulty batteries. The sonde was deployed for a week in the lab with no data collection or battery power issues. Therefore, it appears it was a bad batch of batteries. In the future, before tossing the batteries into the junk bin, they will be evaluated with a volt meter. Unfortunately, they were tossed into the bin first this time and they could not be evaluated."

    "text": "The System-Wide Monitoring Program\nUnderstanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later.",

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nDaily average dissolved oxygen values were mostly within or above their average ranges in 2024, and never fell below the 2 mg/L hypoxia threshold (Figure 5.1). Historically, dissolved oxygen values at Pine Island (Figure 5.2 (a)) and Pellicer Creek (Figure 5.3 (a)) frequently fell below the 2 mg/L hypoxia threshold during the third and fourth quarters. Data for 2024 follows the same trend, falling below threshold from August to October for both sites ((Figure 5.2 (b); Figure 5.3 (b)).\nPellicer Creek is located within a waterbody with known impairments for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, and fecal coliform bacteria. As such, this station frequently experiences low dissolved oxygen values, particularly in the summer months (Figure 5.3). Dissolved oxygen at Pine Island has been uncharacteristically low in the past two years (Figure 5.2).\nChlorophyll a values were often higher than average at all stations this year, especially at Pine Island and San Sebastian (Figure 5.4). However, Pine Island data for quarter 4 were closer to average and fell below the state threshold for that waterbody (6.6 μg/L) each month. The annual geometric mean (AGM) chlorophyll a values were above the state threshold levels at all stations except for Fort Matanzas (Figure 5.5).\nTotal Nitrogen (TN) is calculated by adding Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Nitrate and Nitrite. It accounts for the inorganic nitrogen fraction as well as larger pools of organic bioavailable forms. Several of the nitrate and nitrite values fell below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Central Lab’s minimum detection limit; therefore, TN monthly concentration means were unable to be calculated for multiple months across all stations (Figure 5.6). This was especially true at Fort Matanzas, which has the least amount of TN data (Figure 5.6 (c)). The mean monthly TN values for all months in 2024 fell below the state threshold for their respective waterbodies at San Sebastian and Fort Matanzas (Figure 5.6 (b); Figure 5.6 (c)). The majority of Pine Island’s 2024 mean monthly TN concentrations were above the state threshold, while only September’s concentration was higher than the state threshold at Pellicer Creek (Figure 5.6 (a); Figure 5.6 (d)).\nAmmonium (NH4) is directly measured in our samples and is a key inorganic nutrient assimilated by phytoplankton in primary production. NH4 concentrations for 2024 were near or below monthly means most of year at all four stations (Figure 5.7). Concentrations were notably above average at Fort Matanzas in September (Figure 5.7 (c)), Pellicer Creek in August and September (Figure 5.7 (d)), and Pine Island in December (Figure 5.7 (a)).\nNitrite + Nitrate (NO23) concentrations for 2024 were near or above the monthly mean at Pine Island for most of the year, with the last quarter having all three months within or greater than the highest quartile (Figure 5.8 (a)). Concentrations were especially high in January and October at Pine Island, January at San Sebastian, and October at Pellicer Creek (Figure 5.8 (a); Figure 5.8 (b); Figure 5.8 (d)).\nTotal Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is the total concentration of organic nitrogen and ammonia and is directly measured in our samples. TKN concentrations in 2024 were highly variable and frequently deviated from the historical monthly means at all sites Figure 5.9). Pine Island concentrations were notably higher than historical average in January, March, and October, while notably lower than average in July ((Figure 5.9 (a)). San Sebastian had respectively low monthly concentrations in February, April, June, August and December (Figure 5.9 (b)). January was relatively higher than average at Fort Matanzas, while June, August and December were significantly lower than historical concentration means (Figure 5.9 (c)). Pellicer Creek had significant high and low concentrations throughout the year with very few close to historical averages (Figure 5.9 (d)).\nTotal phosphorus (TP) concentrations were below the state threshold at all stations for each month with available concentrations during 2024 (Figure 5.10). Pine Island had highly variable mean monthly concentrations with most months being notably higher or lower than average (Figure 5.10 (a)). Pellicer Creek concentrations were largely below average for 2024, with only January having an average value, and September and October being above average (Figure 5.10 (d)). Most monthly concentrations at San Sebastian were significantly less than average, except for an above average January and an average March (Figure 5.10 (b)). Fort Matanzas concentrations fell mostly below average, while quarter 1 and July were above average. (Figure 5.10 (b); Figure 5.10 (c)).\nPine Island orthophosphate concentrations were relatively stable from April to September in 2024, though they fell both above and below historical monthly averages, while January and all of quarter 4 had significantly higher monthly averages (Figure 5.11 (a)). April – October at San Sebastian had significantly below-average monthly means, with February- March and November- December being near historical average, and January well above historical average (Figure 5.11 (b)). Pellicer Creek had a steady monthly mean increase from April to October of 2024 with concentrations falling below average for all except September- October. Quarter 1 concentrations were relatively high (January and March) and low (February), while November and December’s concentrations fell just above historical mean (Figure 5.11 (d)). Fort Matanzas had the most highly variable mean monthly concentrations, with only October being near average and all other months falling higher or lower than historical data (Figure 5.11 (c)).",

    "text": "6.1 Tropical Cyclones\nThere were two tropical cyclones that had direct impacts in the GTM estuary during this reporting period: Hurricane Debby and Hurricane Helene.\nNortheast Florida felt the impacts of Hurricane Debby August 4-6 as Debby approached Steinhatchee, Florida as a Category 1 hurricane and moved across the state bringing heavy rain and strong winds.\nThe area was impacted by another tropical cyclone, Hurricane Helene in late September. Hurricane Helene made landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida as a Category 4 storm. Very strong winds and rain caused significant storm surge and flooding in Northeast Florida. The impacts of Hurricane Helene can be seen in our SWMP data from September 25–26, however, we did unfortunately experience intermittent battery and sensor malfunctions during the storm, leaving our data incomplete."

    "text": "6.2 Nor’easters\nTypically, a Nor’easter is a storm along the East Coast of the United States with predominating winds from the northeast. These storms can last anywhere from a single day (24 hours) to several days or weeks. Callahan, Leathers, and Callahan Callahan, Leathers, and Callahan (2022) found that these events can produce surges just as severe as tropical cyclone events and occur more frequently. These events are often in the news associated with blizzards in the New England area of the US; however, their impacts to Northeast Florida, including higher water levels, heavy prevailing winds, precipitation, and reduced tidal exchange, can be significant.\nUsing duration of wind directions between 0-100 degrees for greater than 24-hrs at the Pellicer Creek weather station, 13 “Nor’easter” events were identified in 2024 (?tbl-neer). Occasionally, localized wind directions result in values outside of this 0-100 degree window. The longest Nor’easter event occurred October 16th - October 19th, lasting 74.5 hours (?fig-winds-long).

    "text": "8.2 Sonde and Sensor Malfunctions\n\n8.2.1 Wiper Brush Issues\nThe wiper brush fell off on the following deployments:\nPine Island:\n\nJanuary 10 – February 8, 2024 (Irma SN: 20H100465) central wiper SN: 23G100412\n\nSan Sebastian:\n\nDecember 12 – January 10, 2024 (Megalops SN: 16J102351) central wiper SN: 22A106852\nFebruary 8 – March 7, 2024 (Megalops SN: 16J102351) central wiper SN: 22A106852\nSeptember 19 – October 1, 2024 SS (Megalops SN:16J102351) central wiper SN: 22A106852\n\nFort Matanzas:\n\nMay 25 – June 4, 2024 (Nautilus SN: 13H102686) central wiper SN:20H100789\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Depth Dropouts\nThe depth sensor dropped from deployment of sonde Egret (SN: 15E101700) from December 12, 2023 – January 10, 2024 at Pellicer Creek. This resulted in a broken deployment file at December 17, 2023 04:30 in which the depth sensor was completely missing from the second half of this split file. During post-calibrations, the battery compartment was reset (removed battery cap and replaced it) and the depth sensor was reconnected to the data sonde. Post-calibration values were able to be collected and a calibration test of the sensor showed that it was able to be stabilized. Therefore, this sensor and sonde will be redeployed.\nWiped specific conductivity sensor failed at FM on April 30th and caused continual depth dropouts until retrieved on May 9, 2024. Additionally, a wiped specific conductivity sensor malfunctioned around May 25th and caused the depth sensor to fail post deployment checks on June 4, 2024. The central wiper brush fell also fell off during the deployment.\n\n\n8.2.3 Broken Data Files\nSan Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek experienced broken data files. The data files were broken into many different files upon download. Staff initially thought that the central wipers were causing the issues due the sensor data reporting NAN’s during the issues; however, staff are now beginning to suspect the cause of the broken files are due to faulty wiped conductivity/temperature (WCT) probes but further investigation needs to be conducted.\nThe following is a list of deployments that experienced broken data files and all of the WCT probes have been pulled for evaluation:\n\nPC (Egret SN: 15E101700) 12/12/2023, 11:15 – 01/10/2024, 12:00\nSS (Flounder SN: 12L101354) 01/10/2024 12:15 – 02/08/2024 10:15\nFM (Marlin SN: 13E101372) 03/07/2024 09:30 – 04/09/2024 10:15\nSS (Dorian SN: 20H100466) 05/19/2024 19:30 – 05/19/2024 10:00\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Faulty Batteries\nPellicer Creek telemetry and Egret (SN: 15E101700) data sonde experience battery issues during the first quarter of 2024. The PC telemetry station was reporting low battery voltage in February and March. On April 2, 2024 research staff successfully replaced the battery at the telemetry station. Staff confirmed that the power supply elevated after the exchange.\nIn January 2024 the battery voltage on Pellicer Creek sonde, Egret, increased during the deployment which is uncommon. This same battery issue repeated itself each time this sonde was deployed in February and March. In early April when the sonde was getting calibrated the KOR software notified the technician that the datasonde’s internal RTC battery aka coin cell had low voltage. Staff called Xylem/YSI tech support and was told to send the data sonde in for repairs.\n\n\n8.2.5 Chlorophyll Sensor Issues\nSeveral chlorophyll sensors in Q2 and Q3 deployed at all four stations calibrated with a yellow QC score. The yellow QC score means that the sensor gain or offset is near the threshold of calibration limits. The sensor may experience sensor drift. After performing a factory reset calibration and making new standard it was determined that the sensors need replacing."

    "text": "8.3 KOR Software Issues\nIn April, both SS and FM datasondes were freezing the KOR software each time a central wiper sensor was connected to the sondes. After speaking with Xylem/YSI tech support it was recommended to update KOR software to version 1.4.0. This software update resulted in changes to the data file structure and thus compatibility issues when uploading raw data to the CDMO website. The CDMO is currently working on a fix but until then data files are sent to Amber at the CDMO for modification and data upload."

    "text": "8.4 Annual Leveling\nThe GTM research staff completed the annual task of measuring the elevation of the datasonde in Pellicer Creek on April 15 - 16, 2024. The team measured the change in height from a reference benchmark and three positions on the piling holding the sonde. The orthometric height of the sonde tube pin position is used as the station offset when calibrating the depth sensor for the datasonde. The orthometric heights of the positions can also be used to determine if the piling holding the sonde is moving vertically."

    "text": "8.1.1 Sonde and Sensor Failures\nTwo sonde failures and multiple sensor failures (2 Wiped conductivity/ temperature CT sensors and 2 dissolved oxygen sensors) occurred between January and June 2025. The data sondes were sent in for repairs or taken out of rotation and the sensors were replaced since they are no longer covered under warranty.\nAdditionally, four data sondes (Matthew, Irma, Pelican, and Triton) experienced a voltage increase during some of their deployments. This may be an indication that the sonde’s internal RTC battery, aka coin cell, is not functioning properly since both Pelican and Triton later in Q2 experienced complete data sonde failures.\n\n\n8.1.2 Sonde and Sensor Malfunctions\n\n8.1.2.1 Wiper Brush Issues\nThe wiper brush fell off on the following deployments:\nPine Island:\n\nMarch 4 - March 26, 2025 (Irma SN: 20H100465) central wiper SN: 23G100412\nJune 10 - June 26, 2025 (Megalops SN: 16J102351) central wiper SN: 22A106852\n\nPellicer Creek:\n\nFebruary 26 - March 26, 2025 (Triton SN: 13K102679) central wiper SN: 16J100200\n\n\n\n8.1.2.2 Depth Dropouts\nNo depth dropouts during this reporting period.\n\n\n8.1.2.3 Broken Data Files\nPellicer Creek was the only station that had broken data files. The data files were broken into many different files upon download. The exact cause of the broken files are unknown but are possible attributed to a faulty sensor, but further investigation needs to be conducted.\nThe following is a list of deployments that experienced broken data files and all had a sensor failure or malfunction:\n\nPelican (SN: 15E101699) 04/09/2025 10:15 – 04/15/2025 13:15, DO sensor failure\nTriton (SN: 13K102679) 06/06/2025 11:45 – 06/16/2025 13:00, CT sensor failure\nTriton (SN: 13K102679) 06/24/2025 09:45 – 06/27/2025 11:30, DO sensor malfunction\n\n\n\n8.1.2.4 Wiped Conductivity and Temperature Sensor Issues\nThe wiped C/T sensor (SN: 20D101823) in Flounder at Pine Island had a pin corrode and break off during the deployment, leading to missing data for temperature, specific conductivity, and salinity from January 1, 2025 00:00 – January 14, 2025 13:45, with all data missing from January 11, 2025 at 15:15 - January 14, 2025 due to battery failure potentially attributable to this sensor malfunction.\nThe same pin corrosion occurred on the wiped C/T sensor (SN: 24H100098) at Fort Matanzas on Marlin (SN: 13E101372) from January 1, 2025 00:00 - January 14, 2025 11:00.\nAdditionally, the wiped C/T sensor (SN: 20G104544) installed on Triton (SN: 13K102679) failed during the June 6, 2025 11:45 - June 16, 2025 13:00 deployment at Pellicer Creek. Triton was evaluated and redeployed on June 24, 2025 but experienced issues with the dissolved oxygen sensor.\n\n\n8.1.2.5 Chlorophyll Sensor Issues\nOn May 29, 2025, Pelican (SN: 15E101699) stopped working at Pellicer Creek. Staff could not communicate with data sonde so all sensors were removed and placed onto another data sonde for post deployment procedures. All of the sensors registered on the other data sonde except for the total algae sensor (SN: 20C202353). Total algae sensor may not be functioning properly, further evaluation is needed.\n\n\n8.1.2.6 Dissolved Oxygen Sensor Issues\nPine Island experienced two dissolved oxygen sensor failures, the first, dissolved oxygen sensor (SN: 15C105033) deployed on Matthew (SN: 20H100464), failed during the February 11 - March 4, 2025 deployment; and the second, sensor (SN: 13E100915) deployed on Megalops (SN: 16J102351), failed during the June 10 - June 26, 2025 deployment. The dissolved oxygen sensors old and most likely reached life expectancy.\n\n\n8.1.2.7 Telemetry Issues\nResearch staff received low battery notifications from the telemetry station in March, 2025. On March 24, 2025 staff replaced the battery. On March 26, 2025 live telemetered data stopped reporting on the CDMO website. The station was reset station on April 1, 2025 which rectified the issue.\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Leveling\nThe GTM research staff completed the annual task of measuring the elevation of the sonde in Pellicer Creek on March 27 - 28, 2025. The team measured the change in height from a reference benchmark and three positions on the piling holding the sonde. The orthometric height of the sonde tube pin position is used as the station offset when calibrating the depth sensor for the sonde. The orthometric heights of the positions can also be used to determine if the piling holding the sonde is moving vertically.",
